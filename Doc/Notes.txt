Increasing the number of cells is not working, I mean it is reducing the performance of the classifier drastically, may be because it has to learn more parameters with increase in 
number of cells, without increasing the data may reduce the performance as compared. It really is the difference between the test loss and train loss, if the difference between these 
losses were not too much already increasing the number of cells may not help.
Where as increasing number of hidden seems to work and decreases the loss drastically.
